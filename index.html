                    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
                    <p>In the past couple of years we have witnessed an increasing number of efforts to publish structured data on the Web following the Linked Data principles. The <a href="http://lod-cloud.net/" title="Linking Open Data">LOD cloud</a> currently consist of over 300 datasets providing more than 30 billion individual facts, and are interlinked by more than 500 million RDF links ranging from media data sources to government data sources. While some of the best practices concerning the publishing process can be considered to be domain-agnostic it is important to highlight domain-specific challenges and share the lessons learned for particular sorts of data. In our case, we have been focusing our publishing efforts in the past three years on official statistical data. The main contribution of this paper is hence the documentation of the experiences we have gathered in this realm.</p>
	                <p>Official statistics are the empirical evidence needed for policy making and economic research. Statistics offices are also among the most data-savvy organisations in government and often have a strong history of publishing data in electronic form. The fitness of different dissemination formats for re-usable statistical data can be understood along the <a href="http://5stardata.info/">5-star plan for Open Data</a> by Tim Berners-Lee.</p>

                    <h2 id="linked-statistics">Linked Statistics</h2>
                    <p>With the rise of special-purpose, domain-specific formats such as <a href="http://www.scb.se/Pages/List____314011.aspx">PC-Axis</a> [<a href="#r_"></a>] or <a href="http://sdmx.org/">SDMX</a> [<a href="#r_"></a>], re-using statistical data has become more possible. However, with the complexity introduced by these formats, the barrier for consuming the data has raised as well. On the other hand, general-purpose formats such as Microsoft's Excel or CSV are very widely deployed and a number of tools and libraries in any kind of programming language one could possibly think of exist to process them. The down-side of these formats is equally obvious: as much of the high-quality annotations and metadata, that is, how to interpret the observations, is not or only partially captured, the data fidelity suffers. Even worse, using these formats, the data and metadata typically gets separated. With linked statistics, one can leverage the existing infrastructure as well as retaining metadata along with the data, yielding high data fidelity, consumable in a standardised, straight-forward way. However, the handling of statistical data as Linked Data requires particular attention in order to maintain its integrity and fidelity.</p>

					<p>Going beyond the operations of slicing, filtering and visualising statistical data typically requires out-of-band information to combine it with other kinds of data. Contextual information is usually not found in the statistical data itself. Using linked statistics, we are able to perform this data integration task in a more straight-forward way by leveraging the contextual information provided by the typed links between the data items of one data set to other datasets in the LOD cloud.</p>

					<p>Last but not least, what linked statistics provide, and in fact enable, are queries across datasets: given the dimensions are linked, one can learn from a certain observation's dimension value, other provided dimension values, enabling the automation of cross-dataset queries, hence cutting down integration costs and delivering results quicker.</p>

					<p>Organisations that are involved in publishing statistical Linked Data and establishing related methodologies and best practices include the <a href="http://data.gov.uk">UK Government</a> [<a href="#r_"></a>], the National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies (<dfn><abbr title="National Institute of Statistics and Economic Studies">INSEE</abbr></dfn>, France), the U.S. Bureau of Labour Statistics (<dfn><abbr title="Bureau of Labour Statistics">BLS</abbr></dfn>), and the European Environment Agency (<dfn><abbr title="European Environment Agency">EEA</abbr></dfn>). Statistics from many other sources are currently published not by the original statistics producer, but by third parties (universities, web technology companies etc.): U.S. Census 2000, Spanish Census, including historical microdata, EU election results, <a href="http://img.org/">International Monetary Fund</a> (<dfn><abbr title="International Monetary Fund">IMF</abbr></dfn>) commodity prices to name a few as well as the data from Central Statistics Office Ireland, Eurostat, and World Bank, which we will focus on in this paper.</p>

                    <h2 id="case-studies">Case Studies</h2>
                    <p>In this section we report on details of the publishing process per case study and highlight commonalities as well as discuss differences regarding modelling, conversion, interlinking and provided metadata.</p>

                    <h3 id="data-sources">Data Sources</h3>

                    <h4 id="data-source_cso-ireland">CSO Ireland</h4>
                    <p>The <a href="http://cso.ie/">Central Statistics Office</a> (<dfn><abbr title="Central Statistics Office">CSO</abbr></dfn>) [<a href="r_"></a>] is the official Irish agency responsible for collecting and disseminating statistics about Ireland. The main source of the statistical data for the CSO is the National Census that is scheduled to be held every five years. The data compiled by the CSO serve as a key input for decision-making in the Irish government and it informs its policies and programmes both at national and local levels.</p>

                    <p>The CSO publishes population statistics in several ways, none of which is particularly suited for direct reuse. The data is primarily available through the CSO's website, formatted for the purpose of display. The CSO offers access to raw demographic data in PC-Axis format for expressing multidimensional statistical data. CSO exposes raw data in an interactive data viewer provided by the <a href="http://www.beyond2020.com/">Beyond 20/20 software</a> [<a href="r_"></a>] that allows to browse, sort and plot the data. It offers a way to export the data in XLS and CSV.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-source_eurostat">Eurostat</h4>
                    <p><a href="http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat">Eurostat</a> [<a href="r_"></a>] is the statistical office of European Union with the aim to provide European Union statistical information in a way that can be comparable at European level. Statistical data collection is done by statistical authorities of each Member States. They verify and analyse the data before sending it to Eurostat. Eurostat's role is to consolidate the statistical data they receive from each Member States and ensure that they are comparable. Eurostat actually only provides harmonized statistical data using common statistical language.</p>

                    <p>Eurostat offers access to datasets using the <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing">bulk download facility</a> [<a href="r_"></a>]. The datasets are published by Eurostat in three different formats: TSV, DFT and SDMX. This makes it possible for users to import the data into the tool of their choice. A complete list of datasets which are published by Eurostat is made available through <a href="http://epp.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/NavTree_prod/everybody/BulkDownloadListing?sort=1&#38;file=table_of_contents.xml">table of contents</a> [<a href="r_"></a>]. Although there is no filtration on the different types of statistics provided by Eurostat, the datasets essentially cover statistical information along the following themes: general and regional statistics, economy and finance, population and social conditions, industry, trade and services, agriculture and fisheries, external trade, transport, environment and energy, and science and technology.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-source_world-bank">World Bank</h4>
                    <p>The <a href="http://worldbank.org/">World Bank</a> [<a href="r_"></a>] is an international development organization that provides access to a comprehensive set of data about countries around the globe. The publicly available statistical data is collected from officially-recognized international sources, and consists of a wide array of observations on development indicators, financial statements, climate change, projects and operations.</p>

                    <p>The World Bank provides a free and open access to numerous datasets in their <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog">data catalog</a> [<a href="r_"></a>]. These datasets are available in one or more formats: XML, JSON, CSV, XLS; with additional geospatial data in SHP and KML, and supporting documentations in PDF. The World Bank APIs offers some of the datasets primarily in XML and JSON representations, whereas the rest of the formats are available as data dumps. In our use-case, the decision on which datasets to work with was based on several factors such as the importance of the dataset, its completeness, and the ease of converting it into an RDF representation. Hence, the following datasets from the World Bank's API were selected with the preference of working with XML:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/climate-data-api">World Bank Climate Change</a> (<dfn><abbr title="World Bank Climate Change">WBCC</abbr></dfn>) [<a href="r_"></a>] contains data from historical observations and future projections derived from global circulation models.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a> (<dfn><abbr title="World Development Indicators">WDI</abbr></dfn>) [<a href="r_"></a>] contain various global development data on world view, people, the environment, the economy, states and markets, and global links. It includes national, regional and global estimates.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://finances.worldbank.org/">World Bank Finances</a> (<dfn><abbr title="World Bank Finances">WBF</abbr></dfn>) [<a href="r_"></a>] cover Bank's investments, assets it manages on behalf of global funds, and the Bank's own financial statements.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/projects-portfolio">World Bank Projects and Operations</a> (<dfn><abbr title="World Bank Projects and Operations">WBPO</abbr></dfn>) [<a href="r_"></a>] provides information about the lending projects from 1947 to present along with links to publicly disclosed online documents.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>Figures [<a href="#figure_architecture_cso-ireland">1</a>], [<a href="#figure_architecture_eurostat">2</a>], [<a href="#figure_architecture_world-bank">3</a>] illustrate an overview on the overall architecture of the deployment of our three case studies. They will be discuss in further detail in the following sections.</p>

                    <h3 id="data-retrieval">Data Retrieval</h3>
                    <h4 id="data-retrieval_cso-ireland">CSO Ireland</h4>
                    <p>Data from the 2006 Irish Census were retrieved manually, downloading each slice of small area population statistics individually via the export to Excel files from the <a href="http://beyond2020.cso.ie/census/ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx">CSO's instance of the Beyond 20/20</a> [<a href="r_"></a>]. 14 datasets in CSV format in total of 8MB were manually retrieved using the interactive application by clicking on the access URLs.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-retrieval_eurostat">Eurostat</h4>
                    <p>There are approximately 6100 datasets published by Eurostat. Eurostat updates information about datasets as well as table of contents twice a day. The datasets holds statistics on daily, monthly, quarterly and annual basis. Therefore, certain datasets are updated daily and many datasets are updated on monthly basis. To keep Eurostat RDF datasets up to date, we've scheduled a cronjob, which runs a set of scripts on weekly basis. In order to avoid unnecessary RDF transformations of each dataset, we've only updated the changed datasets within the past week as shown in figure <a href="figure_architecture_eurostat">2</a>.</p>

                    <p>Along with the datasets, Eurostat also publishes Data Structure Definitions (<dfn><abbr title="Data Structure Definition">DSD</abbr></dfn>) about each dataset, as well as a set of dictionaries (code lists) which are shared among all datasets. Hence we take into consideration every type of information provided by Eurostat. The DSDs are published in XML format while the code lists are published in TSV format. Dataset is available in three different formats: TSV, DFT and SDMX. Given that the datasets, metadata and code lists each provide different type of information and is represented differently, we wrote Java programs to process XML and TSV formats of the metadata, dataset and code lists separately.</p>

                    <p>In order to transform Eurostat datasets into RDF datasets, an XML parser in Java was written to parse the table of contents to create a list of datasets available to download from Eurostat‚Äôs bulk download facility. For each dataset entry found in the table of contents, it downloaded the respective dataset in TSV format, metadata in XML format and code lists in TSV format from Eurostat‚Äôs bulk download facility. Later, custom written Java programs were invoked to parse the dataset, metadata and code lists and transform them into RDF format. We have written different shell scripts which wrap each Java program and one main script which handles the whole process of data downloading and transformation by invoking other scripts as depicted in figure <a href="figure_architecture_eurostat">2</a>.</p>

                    <p>Over 13000 HTTP GET requests were made to Eurostat to download raw datasets, DSDs and code lists, with a total of disk space of ~58GB.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-retrieval_world-bank">World Bank</h4>
                    <p>The World Bank datasets were collected by making requests to the World Bank API endpoints using the XML output format.</p>

                    <p>World Bank APIs were called ~150000 times to retrieve all of the WDI, WBF, WBCC, WBPO datasets, with a total disk space of ~20GB.</p>

                    <p>The data is retrieved at irregular periods - at least once a month - from the World Bank API endpoints. The retrieval act is partly based on new dataset announcements in World Bank mailing lists. Although the data retrieval and transformation phases are conducted by independent scripts, the commitment to retrieve and store the data is based on achieving the quality of the eventual RDF serialization. Therefore, Java and Bash scripts are manually executed to retrieve, in order to closely monitor abnormalities in the responses and account for necessary changes in the transformations.</p>


                    <h3 id="data-preprocessing">Data Preprocessing</h3>
                    <p>In this section, we cover some of the observed abnormalities in the original datasets, and the decisions which were made in order to later achieve reasonable RDF serializations. The information in this section is not exhaustive, and is only meant to illustrate some of the recurring challenges.</p>

                    <p> The data was paged to several files that had to be pieced together, saved as CSV files, and provided with a different character encoding. Statistical data in the retrieved datasets were attributed to one of two mutually overlapping conceptualizations of Irish geography. There were datasets coded with enumeration areas and datasets coded with electoral districts. Both types of datasets were downloaded and combined during the conversion to RDF.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-preprocessing_eurostat">Eurostat</h4>
                    <p>Although, our data set parser parses TSV files to generate observation values using RDF Data Cube vocabulary but TSV files misses the frequency value which is necessary to represent observation value. In order to add frequency value to the observations of each data set, we additionally parsed SDMX format to retrieve the frequency value of each data set.</p>

                    <p>Observations with values <code>:</code> which means <em>not available</em> were left out during the RDF transformations.</p>

                    <p><code>dcterms:date</code> property was used for reference periods in Eurostat. We have encountered various reference periods and converted them into appropriate date literals while doing RDF transformation:</p>
                    <p>YYYY-MM-DD date format was used where we encountered reference periods like: <code>{YYYY}M{MM}D{DD}</code>, <code>{YYYY}Q{QQ}</code>, <code>{YYYY}M{MM}</code>, <code>{YYYY}S{SS}</code>, <code>{YYYY}</code>.</p>
                    <p>YYYY-MM-DD date format was used where we encountered reference periods like: <code>{YYYY}_{YYYY}</code>. We do not have time format information available in the data set which makes it hard to tell if the observation values are for 1 or x number of years.</p>

                    <p>Certain observation values represent reference period values as Long Term Annual Average (<dfn><abbr title="Long Term Annual Average">LTAA</abbr></dfn>). We did not know how to deal with LTAA in RDF and Eurostat does not provide any information about it in the metadata of that particular dataset. Hence, we wrote a small Turtle file which contains the definition of LTAA. Reference periods mentioning LTAA in original dataset for any particular observation value were represented in RDF using the URI of Turtle file.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-preprocessing_world-bank">World Bank</h4>
                    <p>In order to arrive at a proper and useful Linked Data representation, some of the following problems were solved either with a script or manually updated, and others were brought up to the World Bank team's attention for investigation.</p>

                    <p>For preprocessing, we've identified several recurring issues in the original data, and decided on workable solutions. They are: units of measurements in the observations were part of the indicator string were left as is; missing observation values in the API response were excluded in the transformation phase resulting in ~80% reduction in number of observations with actual measured data; various naming patterns (primarily regions) in WBF differed from WDI such that alternative names had to be added to WBF in order to arrive at canonical representations during the XSLT process; missing country codes which were identified in the WDI observations but not in the country code list was added.</p>

                    <h3 id="data-modeling">Data Modeling</h3>
                    <p>In this section we go over several areas which is at the heart of representing statistical data as Linked Data. Which vocabularies are reused and created, URI design patterns, and Data Cube's data structure definitions are discussed for each of the case studies.</p>

                    <h4 id="vocabularies">Vocabularies</h4>
                    <p>All three data models reuse the usual suspects: RDF, RDFS, XSD, OWL, XSD, FOAF, and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube</a> [<a href="r_"></a>] is used to describe multi-dimensional statistical data, <a href="http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx">SDMX</a> for the statistical information model, British reference periods (<a href="http://reference.data.gov.uk/doc/year">Year</a>, <a href="http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/gregorian-interval/">Gregorian Interval</a>), <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core">SKOS</a> to describe the concepts in the observations, and <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">DC Terms</a> for general purpose metadata relations.</p>

                    <p>The first versions of the converted data in CSO Ireland relied on elements from SDMX/RDF but these elements were subsequently replaced with more generic elements from the Data Cube Vocabulary (e.g., <code>qb:Observation</code> instead of <code>sdmx:Observation</code>) or SKOS (e.g., <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code> in place of <code>sdmx:code list</code>).</p>

                    <p>In the World Bank case of country codes, <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/background_on_iso_3166/iso_3166-2.htm">ISO 3166-2</a> [<a href="r_"></a>] is used as the primary representation for countries. For example, the URI <code><a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CA">http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CA</a></code> identifies the country <em>Canada</em> in the datasets.</p>


                    <h4 id="uri-patterns">URI Patterns</h4>
                    <p>TODO --------------------------  <strong>Michael</strong></p>
                    <p>All three datasets make use of <em>slash URIs</em> throughout the schema and data, with the exception that Eurostat uses hash URIs for its observations. The reason for this was to keep the URI patterns consistent and to make sure that all important resources when dereferenced returned information. Since the content size of the responses for statistical data may be heavy, the <em>slash URIs</em> approach appeared to be preferable to <em>hash URIs</em>, as the latter would not allow distinct requests in majority of the deployments on the Web. This is of course independent to accessing these resources via SPARQL endpoints.</p>


                    <h5 id="uri-patterns_cso-ireland">CSO Ireland</h5>
                    <p>All the resources in the 2006 Irish Census dataset use slash URIs. The geographical code lists for enumeration areas and electoral districts employ hierarchical URIs [<a href="#r_">24</a>], in which identifiers of geographical areas are nested within the "namespace" URIs of their parent geographical features (e.g., an enumeration area nested under a county) [<a href="#r_25">25</a>].</p>

                    <p>In 2006 Irish Census dataset, blank nodes (<dfn><abbr title="blank nodes">bnodes</abbr></dfn>) were used only for identification of instances of <code>qb:ComponentSpecification</code>. All other resources were identified with URIs.</p>

                    <h5 id="uri-patterns_eurostat">Eurostat</h5>
                    <p>The base URI for Eurostat is <code>http://eurostat.linked-statistics.org/</code>. We kept same file name for the metadata and the actual dataset containing observation values as they appear in original data and distinguish them by using <code>dsd</code> and <code>data</code> in URI patterns. Further, the code lists which are shared among all datasets are provided by using <code>dic</code> in the pattern. The following URI patterns are used:</p>

                    <p id="uri-patterns_eurostat_metadata"><em>Metadata</em>: (DSDs) have the pattern <code>http://eurostat.linked-statistics.org/dsd/{id}</code>, where id is one of the dataset's metadata file.</p>
                    <p id="uri-patterns_eurostat_datasets"><em>Datasets</em>: are within <code>http://eurostat.linked-statistics.org/data/{id}</code>, where id is the filename for the dataset containing observation values.</p>
                    <p id="uri-patterns_eurostat_code-lists"><em>Code lists</em>: use the pattern <code>http://eurostat.linked-statistics.org/dic/{id}</code>, where id is the dictionary filename.</p>
                    <p id="uri-patterns_eurostat_observations"><em>Observations</em>: use the pattern <code>http://eurostat.linked-statistics.org/data/{dataset}#{dimension1},{dimensionN}</code>, where the order of dimension values in the URI space depends on the order of dimension values present in the data set.</p>

                    <h5 id="uri-patterns_world-bank">World Bank</h5>
                    <p>New URIs for classifications and properties were created because majority of the properties and concepts did not already exist in the wild, and in cases where they did, they did not fully correspond with the World Bank's. For instance, the country codes in the World Bank data are not only composed of concepts of countries, but also other geopolitical areas and income levels.</p>

                    <p>Terms in the URIs are in lower-case and delimited with the minus-sign. The dimension values are used as the terms in the URI space and are delimited with a slash.</p>

                    <p>The general URI space consists of:</p>

                    <p id="uri-patterns_world-bank_classification"><em>Classifications</em> are composed of code lists for various concepts that are used in the World Bank datasets. The concepts are compiled by using the accompanied metadata from the World Bank, and are typed with <code>skos:Concept</code>. Each code list is of type <code>skos:code list</code> and have a URI pattern of <code>http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/{id}</code>, where id is one of; <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country"></a>country, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/income-level">income-level</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/indicator">indicator</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/lending-type">lending-type</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/region">region</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/source">source</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/topic">topic</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/project">project</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/currency">currency</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/loan-type">loan-type</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/loan-status">loan-status</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/variable">variable</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/global-circulation-model">global-circulation-model</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/scenario">scenario</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/basin">basin</a>.

                    <p id="uri-patterns_world-bank_named-graphs"><em>Named graphs in RDF store</em> are placed in <code>http://worldbank.270a.info/graph/{id}</code>, where id is one of; <code>meta</code>, <code>world-development-indicators</code>, <code>world-bank-finances</code>, <code>world-bank-climates</code>, <code>world-bank-projects-and-operations</code>.</p>

                    <p id="uri-patterns_world-bank_blank-nodes"><em>Bnodes</em>: By in large, the datasets do not contain bnodes, with the exception of unavoidable ones in the Projects and Operations code list. In order to offer a metadata file for World Bank's schema, some of the files with bnodes had to be merged. In order to avoid the conflict on collapsing bnodes with the same identifier, the decision to carry this out was based on a method that happened to be most efficient; import all of the metadata files into a named graph in RDF store, then export the named graph to a single file.</p>



                    <h4 id="data-structure-definition">Data Structure Definitions</h4>
                    <p>TODO --------------------------  <strong>Michael</strong></p>

                    <h5 id="data-structure-definition_cso-ireland">CSO Ireland</h5>
                    <p>In most cases, the data structure of the 2006 Irish Census data in RDF follows the structure of the source data, even though the transposition of the modelling patterns from the original data to its RDF version was not optimal from the perspective of modelling data in the Data Cube vocabulary. For example, for every source file representing an individual view on the Census data an instance of <code>qb:DataStructureDefinition</code> was created with dimensions that preserved the structure of the original file. Following this guideline data aggregation into a multidimensional data cube was deferred to a later stages of data processing.</p>

                    <p>Nevertheless, the guideline of preserving the original data structure was not adhered to in all of the cases. There were labels used inconsistently in the source data. For example, both "Geographical Area" and "Geographic Area" were used in the data. In such cases, where multiple labels referred to the same concept, they were merged.</p>

                    <p>The same treatment was applied on the extracted code lists that were reconstructed in RDF in a way copying their original structure. For example, multiple separate code lists for age were recreated in RDF and mapped together. A number of code lists featured "Total" as a coded value. This practice was also retained in RDF versions of these code lists.</p>

                    <h5 id="data-structure-definition_eurostat">Eurostat</h5>
                    <p>Eurostat publishes data structure definition of each dataset separately. Eurostat data structure definition consists of <em>concepts</em>, <em>code lists</em> and <em>components</em>. The <em>component</em> wraps all of the <em>concepts</em> and their associated <em>code lists</em> defined in a particular data structure definition. We defined all concepts as <code>skos:Concept</code> in our modeling approach. Further, all the code lists were defined as <code>skos:ConceptScheme</code>.</p>

                    <p>Eurostat publishes their own code lists as well as reuse SDMX code lists. For example, Eurostat uses their own custom code list to represent different indicators but reuse Frequency code lists from <a href="http://sdmx.org/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/02_sdmx_cog_annex_2_cl_2009.pdf">SDMX content-oriented guidelines</a> [<a href="r_"></a>].</p>

                    <h5 id="data-structure-definition_world-bank">World Bank</h5>
                    <p>Each dataset from the World Bank was treated on a case by case basis for DSDs as they had different data models:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><em>World Development Indicators</em> are available as a single observation model where it contains indicators, reference areas, and time series as dimension values, and the corresponding measurement value.</li>
                        <li><em>World Bank Finances</em> come in several sub-datasets with different structures i.e., the observations in the datasets contain different set of dimensions, along with a number of measurements and attributes.</li>
                        <li><em>World Bank Climate Change</em> contains sub-datasets for different historical and future observations. They primarily include data on; reference area, reference periods, statistical types (averages and anomalies), measured variables and derived statistics, global circulation models.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p><em>World Bank Projects and Operations</em> are treated as a code list of <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/project">projects</a>.</p>



                    <h3 id="data-conversion">Data Conversion</h3>
                    <p>TODO --------------------------  <strong>Michael</strong></p>

                    <h4 id="data-conversion_cso-ireland">CSO Ireland</h4>
                    <p>The conversion of 2006 Irish Census data was conducted with a custom Python script based on librdf [<a href="r_"></a>]. Due to a relatively small volume of the data the conversion was initially implemented using an in-memory RDF store. Nevertheless, we have discovered it to be insufficient for every but the smallest datasets. Consequently, to cater for the larger datasets, the implementation switched to a file back-end based on <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/berkeleydb/overview/index.html">BerkeleyDB</a> [<a href="r_"></a>].</p>

                    <p>Still, the back-end was not capable of handling the computation of aggregated values using SPARQL queries. To compute aggregates a more performant, standalone triple store would be needed. Ultimately, we have decided to keep the back-end and postpone generation of aggregate values to a later stage when the data would be loaded into a triple store.</p>

                    <p>Another implementation trade-off that we had to make was related to the SPARQL engine in librdf. Due to the engine not being able to execute certain types of SPARQL queries, queries were de-optimized in order for the engine to process them. For example, direct use of URIs in SPARQL graph patterns was not handled properly so that the URIs were matched in the <code>FILTER</code> clause.</p>

                    <p>The most time consuming task of the conversion regarded "reverse engineering" of code lists used in the data. Most code lists were reconstructed manually from the headers and column names in the original data. However, unlike the majority of code lists containing several items, geographical code lists were too large to be processed manually and thus it was necessary to automate their extraction. Geographical code lists, such as the enumeration areas, had to be distilled from the statistical data referring to them. Since the statistical data contained little information about the code lists (e.g., code-name pairs), it was difficult to establish identity in them (e.g., resolve name clashes).</p>

                    <h4 id="data-conversion_eurostat">Eurostat</h4>
                    <p>Various tools have been used in the publishing process: our custom-written Java program was first used to download and transform the Eurostat datasets, meta data and the code lists into RDF. Eurostat publishes more than 6100 datasets which when converted into RDF took more than 537GB of disk space yielding ~8 billion triples altogether. Instead of hosting such a huge number of triples via an SPARQL endpoint, we generated a catalog file which contains a set of triples specifying the location of a particular dataset on the file system.</p>

                    <p>The updated datasets are reflected through <code>lastUpdate</code> date field associated to each dataset in the table of contents file. We have scheduled a cron job which runs every weekend and execute the following steps:</p>

                    <ol>
                        <li>Download the new table of contents file and compare it against last week table of contents file. Compare the <code>lastUpdate</code> field from the two table of contents file for each dataset;</li>
                        <li>For all those datasets, whose <code>lastUpdate</code> field has changed, add them to the conversion list;</li>
                        <li>For each dataset in the conversion list, invoke the necessary scripts to download dataset and their associated meta data and transform them into RDF.</li>
                        <li>Replace existing RDF datasets as well as metadata with the new updated RDF datasets and metadata;</li>
                        <li>Update SPARQL endpoint;</li>
                        <li>Replace the old table of contents file with the new table of contents file for comparison in the next week cron job.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <p>The approximate time of updating Eurostat RDF datasets on weekly basis is 3-4 days depending on the number of datasets updated or added in a week time. We have also setup a mailing list [] which provides information on our weekly updates to the interested Eurostat users. After the update has been completed, an email is automatically sent to the mailing list describing the number of datasets which has been modified, added, and deleted.</p>

                    <p>Some of the code list names in Eurostat reuse the names in SDMX-XML codes, hence, they were kept as is since the RDF Data Cube vocabulary already uses SDMX-RDF. For other cases, they were renamed to closest possible vocabularies in RDF.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-conversion_world-bank">World Bank</h4>
                    <p>XSLT 2.0 stylesheets were created to transform the source XML files to target RDF/XML serializations. Saxon's command-line XSLT and XQuery Processor tool was used for the transformations, and employed as part of Bash scripts to iterate through all the files in the datasets. The conversion step from the command-line with <code>saxonb-xslt</code> under the Ubuntu operating system was preferred over Java's <code>SAXTransformerFactory</code> Class as it was significantly faster in preliminary tests.</p>

                    <p>In order to import this data into the RDF store rather efficiently, <a href="http://librdf.org/raptor/rapper.html">rapper</a> RDF parser utility [<a href="r_"></a>] program was used to first re-serialize each RDF/XML file as N-Triples and appended to a single file at run-time before importing.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-interlinking">Data Interlinking</h4>
                    <p>Interlinking things and concepts from our RDF datasets to external datasets in the LOD Cloud was a challenging task. It primarily requires the investigation of identifying eligible resource types in our datasets, and then finding suitable matches that are available externally. One useful requirement was to make sure that the target resources were dereferenable in order to make the interlinking worthwhile. Tables [<a href="#data-interlinking_cso-ireland_table">1</a>], [<a href="#data-interlinking_eurostat_table">2</a>], [<a href="#data-interlinking_world-bank_table">3</a>] gives an overview of the targeted external datasets, entity types, links, and counts for each case three cases respectively.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-enrichment">Data Enrichment</h4>
                    <p>In this section we talk about some of the ways that we've tried to enrich the original data by adding information such that the datasets can be more useful, easily discovered, interlinked or queried.</p>

                    <h5 id="data-enrichment_cso-ireland">CSO Ireland</h5>
                    <p>The only data enrichment for CSO Ireland was the addition of World Geodetic System <dfn><abbr title="World Geodetic System">WGS</abbr></dfn> triples using <code>rdf:type</code> of <code>wgs:Point</code>, as well as latitude and longitude using <code>wgs:lat</code> and <code>wgs:long</code> to the descriptions of Irish city resources.</p>

                    <h5 id="data-enrichment_eurostat">Eurostat</h5>
                    <p><code>rdf:datatype</code>s were added to observation values in each dataset. The reason is some datasets has combination of numeric and decimal values which makes it harder to query or the user has to cast the datatype for observation values with different data types before making query. To avoid data type casting at query level, we pre processed all observation values of a dataset and associated the appropriate data type to all observation values in a particular dataset before serializing it into RDF.</p>

                    <h5 id="data-enrichment_world-bank">World Bank</h5>
                    <p>A code list for currencies was created based on <a href="http://www.currency-iso.org/iso_index/iso_tables/iso_tables_a1.htm">ISO 4217</a> currency and funds name [<a href="r_"></a>] to represent the SDMX attributes for the amount measurements in the World Bank Finances datasets. They were also linked to each country which officially uses that currency. Given that some of the codes in the World Bank country code list are not considered to be countries e.g., <code>1W</code> representing <em>World</em>, only the resources which represented a real country have an added <code>rdf:type</code> instance of <code>dbo:Country</code>.</p>


                    <h4 id="rdf-datasets">RDF Datasets</h4>
                    <p>Tables [<a href="#linked-dataset_cso-ireland_table">4</a>], [<a href="#linked-dataset_eurostat_table">5</a>], [<a href="#linked-dataset_world-bank_table">6</a>] outlines the current state of RDF Linked Datasets for CSO Ireland, Eurostat, and World Bank.

                    <h4 id="user-interface">User-interface</h4>
                    <p>Here we briefly discuss how the published data can be access primarily using a Web browser.</p>
                    <h5 id="user-interface_cso-ireland">CSO Ireland</h5>
                    <p>The website is located at <code><a href="http://data-gov.ie/">http://data-gov.ie/</a></code> [<a href="r_"></a>]. The HTML pages are generated and published by the <a href="https://github.com/csarven/linked-data-pages">Linked Data Pages</a> framework [<a href="r_"></a>]. Linked Data Pages is used to invoke unique SPARQL queries based on the requested URI. The results are outputted in corresponding HTML templates. Links to alternate RDF formats as well as in JSON are handled by content-negotiation. Given the nature of the invoked SPARQL query, alternate formats may contain additional triples like labels for the vocabulary terms that&#8217;s not in the RDF dumps. This minor difference is mentioned for the users on the site. For some resources e.g., Cities, <a href="https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/">Google Charts Tools</a> [<a href="r_"></a>] is used to display various visualizations in place of the tabular data in the HTML.</p>
                    <h5 id="user-interface_eurostat">Eurostat</h5>
                    <p>The website is located at <code><a href="http://eurostat.linked-statistics.org/">http://eurostat.linked-statistics.org/</a></code> [<a href="r_"></a>] where it contains custom static HTML pages, with links to dump directories, and SPARQL endpoint.</p>

                    <h4 id="sparql-endpoint">SPARQL Endpoint</h4>
                    <p>The SPARQL endpoints are accessible publicly with no authorization requirements. As a trade-off, the SPARQL service is subject to high resource demands from the server for certain query types. No query restrictions were placed in neither of the cases.</p>

This endpoint includes only the schema and excludes the data (~533GB RDF/XML) due to the limitation of the available resources and performance reasons.</p>

Data in RDF format was incrementally loaded from into TDB RDF store using Jena's <code>tdbloader</code> script from command-line. A public <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/sparql">SPARQL endpoint</a> [<a href="r_"></a>] is available which accepts SPARQL 1.1 queries. The endpoint allows access to the full schema and datasets, and uses named graphs.</p>


                    <h4 id="data-dumps">Data Dumps</h4>
                    <p>The data dumps come in different formats, primarily either available in native RDF formats, or they are compressed for easy retrieval.

                    <h2 id="related-work">Related Work</h2>
                    <p>The related work reveals that there are a variety of approaches that are undertaken to deploy statistical Linked Data. Given the rapid development in this field; publicly open and accessible statistical data from governments to various independent organisations, as well as best practices to publish Linked Data have started to emerge.</p>

                    <p>An experiment with publishing statistical data that was alike to the described use-cases in both scope and extent is described in Salas et al., 2012. [<a href="#r_2">2</a>] The work conducted in this case took statistical data from <a href="http://dados.gov.br">dados.gov.br</a>, a Brazilian data portal, as its input; focusing on CSV files and data from OLAP. The tools developed for conversion of source data to RDF were implemented as <a href="http://ontowiki.net/">OntoWiki</a> extensions. <a href="https://github.com/AKSW/cubeviz.ontowiki">CubeViz</a> was used to visualize the multidimensional statistical data. The data was interlinked with DBpedia and Geonames using the LIMES software. Among the problems encountered the authors list a need for data pre-processing into a desired share, encoding non-ASCII characters to UTF-8, and difficulties in dealing with ambiguities stemming from multiple resources sharing the same string labels.</p>

                    <p>One of the first statistical datasets expressed with the Data Cube vocabulary that was not published by a research institute is the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/information_society/digital-agenda/scoreboard/index_en.htm">EU Digital Agenda Scoreboard</a>. In this case, statistical data serves as an input for evidence-based policy monitoring the implementation of the goals of Digital Agenda for Europe strategy. More than 100 thousand triples from the data on the performance indicators monitored for the Digital Agenda for Europe in EU member countries is published with OntoWiki both in HTML, CSV, RDF, and JSON. [<a href="#scoreboard"></a>] The data is enriched with 33 thousand links to the RDF version of Eurostat data presented in this paper. The authors of the converted data report being limited in the possibilities for interlinking. Either the relevant datasets are not available in RDF or are not among the datasets approved for linking by Eurostat. [<a href="#r_3">3</a>]</p>
