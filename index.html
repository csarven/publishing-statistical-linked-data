                    <p>The World Bank is an international development organization that provides access to a comprehensive set of data about countries around the globe. The publicly available statistical data is collected from officially-recognized international sources, and consists of a wide array of observations on development indicators, financial statements, climate change, projects and operations.</p>

                    <p>The Central Statistics Office (<dfn><abbr title="Central Statistics Office">CSO</abbr>) is the official Irish agency responsible for collecting and disseminating statistics about Ireland. The main source of the statistical data for the CSO is the National Census that is scheduled to be held every five years. The data compiled by the CSO serve as a key input for decision-making in the Irish government and it informs its policies and programmes both at national and local levels.</p>

                    <p>The original statistical data, which was a subject to conversion to RDF in a pilot experiment conducted during the summer of 2010 at the Linked Data Research Centre in DERI, was a result of the 2006 Irish Census. A subset of the bulk of the census data that was chosen for the experiment consisted of demographic data tracking small area population statistics (<dfn><abbr title="Small Area Population Statistics">SAPS</abbr></dfn>).</p>

                    <h4 id="data-source_world-bank">World Bank</h4>
                    <p>The World Bank provides a free and open access to numerous datasets in their <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog">data catalog</a>. These datasets are available in one or more formats: XML, JSON, CSV, XLS; with additional data in SHP and supporting documentations in PDF. The World Bank APIs offers some of the datasets primarily in XML and JSON representations, whereas the rest of the formats are available as data dumps. In our use-case, the decision on which datasets to work with was based on several factors such as the importance of the dataset, its completeness, and the ease of converting it into an RDF representation, meanwhile working with available resources. Hence, the following datasets from the World Bank's API were selected with the preference of working with XML:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/climate-data-api">World Bank Climate Change</a> (<dfn><abbr title="World Bank Climate Change">WBCC</abbr></dfn>) contains data from historical observations and future projections derived from global circulation models.</li>
                        <li><a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a> (<dfn><abbr title="World Development Indicators">WDI</abbr></dfn>) contain various global development data on world view, people, the environment, the economy, states and markets, and global links. It includes national, regional and global estimates.</li>
                        <li><a href="https://finances.worldbank.org/">World Bank Finances</a> (<dfn><abbr title="World Bank Finances">WBF</abbr></dfn>) cover Bank's investments, assets it manages on behalf of global funds, and the Bank's own financial statements.</li>

                    <h4 id="data-source_cso-ireland">CSO Ireland</h4>
                    <p>The CSO publishes population statistics in several ways, none of which is particularly suited for direct reuse. The data is primarily available through the CSO's web site, formatted for the purpose of display. The CSO offers access to raw demographic data, however, the data is available only in PC-Axis, a domain-specific format for expressing multidimensional statistical data. Besides data in raw the CSO exposes them in an interactive data viewer provided by the <a href="http://www.beyond2020.com/">Beyond 20/20 software</a> that allows to browse, sort and plot the data.</p>

                    <p>The World Bank datasets were collected by making requests to The World Bank API endpoints using the XML output format. The reason for choosing the XML format preference over JSON was to easily transform the data to an RDF/XML serialization with XSLT  by relying on the well established XML tool-chain. Table [<a href="#data-retrieval_world-bank_table">1</a>] provides retrieval information about the datasets.</p>

                    <p>The data is retrieved at irregular periods - at least once a month - from the World Bank API endpoints. The retrieval act is partly based on new dataset announcements in World Bank mailing lists. Although the data retrieval and transformation phases are conducted by independent scripts, the commitment to retrieve and store the data is based on achieving the quality of the eventual RDF serialization. Therefore, Java and Bash scripts are manually executed to retrieve, in order to:</p>

                        <li>closely monitor abnormalities in the responses and;</li>

                    <p>Data from the 2006 Irish Census were retrieved manually, downloading each slice of small area population statistics individually via the export to Excel files from the <a href="http://beyond2020.cso.ie/census/ReportFolders/ReportFolders.aspx">CSO's instance of the Beyond 20/20</a>. The data was paged to several files that had to be pieced together, saved as CSV files, and provided with a different character encoding.</p>

                    <p>Statistical data in the retrieved datasets were attributed to one of two mutually overlapping conceptualizations of Irish geography. There were datasets coded with enumeration areas and datasets coded with electoral districts.

                    <h3 id="data-review">Dataset review and decisions</h3>
                    <p>In this section, we cover some of the observed abnormalities in the original datasets, and the decisions which were made in order to later achieve reasonable RDF serializations. The information in this section is not exhaustive, and is only meant to illustrate some of the recurring challenges.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-review_world-bank">World Bank</h4>
                    <p>In order to arrive at a proper and useful Linked Data representation, some of the following problems were solved either with a script or manually updated, and others were brought up to the World Bank team's attention for investigation.</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_missing-units"><em>Missing units</em>: The statistics of the World Development Indicators consists of various indicators in different measurement units. At the time of this writing, these measurements in the source data are only provided as part of the string of the indicator name, as opposed to an explicit XML node [].</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_missing-values"><em>Missing values</em>: Some of the observations in the World Development Indicators dataset do not have measured data. The nodes for the values were given in the API response, however they contained no numerical values. Hence, in order to keep the RDF format of the dataset lean, these observations were excluded in the data transformation phase. This resulted in ~80% reduction in number of observations with actual measured data [].</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_aggregated-data"><em>Aggregated data</em>: While the World Bank API provides endpoints which compiled aggregate data for the <em>WDI</em>, some of these calls were left out in the retrieval process.</p>


                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_most-recent-values"><em>Most recent values</em>: Most recent values were incorrectly introduced to non-date API calls [] in <em>WDI</em>. These observation nodes were excluded in the transformation phase since the data already contained observations with corresponding reference periods.</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_naming-patterns"><em>Naming patterns</em>: Different naming patterns were identified across World Bank datasets. Some of these are as follows:</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_region-names"><em>Region names</em>: Region names as used in <em>WDI</em> and <em>WBF</em> datasets differed [] in a way that although they essentially conveyed the same meaning, labels did not match exactly. In order to have URIs for the region labels in the <em>WBF</em>  observations, and to simplify the linking process, unique region names from the <em>WBF</em>  observations was added to region resources in <em>WDI</em>. During the XSLT process, the alternative labels were matched with the labels in the observations themselves to arrive at their canonical representations.</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_credit-loan"><em>Credit and Loan names</em>: Based on a private discussion with the WFI team, it was determined that the vocabulary terms <em>Credit Status</em> and <em>Loan Status</em>, as well as <em>Credit Number</em> and <em>Loan Number</em> was used interchangeably. Thus, the canonical representation for the Linked Data URI pattern was to use one: <em>Loan Status</em> and <em>Loan Number</em>.</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_missing-countries"><em>Missing countries</em>: Some country codes were identified in the <em>WDI</em> observations that were not defined in the <em>WDI</em> country code list. These were later added to the original data [] [].</p>

                    <p>Besides RDF, RDFS, XSD, OWL, the most common vocabularies in these datasets are: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube</a> to describe multi-dimensional statistical data, <a href="http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx">SDMX</a> for the statistical information model, British reference periods (<a href="http://reference.data.gov.uk/doc/year">Year</a>, <a href="http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/gregorian-interval/">Gregorian Interval</a>), <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core">SKOS</a> to describe the concepts in the observations, and <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">DC Terms</a> for general purpose metadata relations. Where appropriate, properties and classifications were created to represent World Bank Linked Data. The <em><a href="#uri-patterns">URI patterns</a></em> section gives a further break down of this.</p>

                    <p>Properties that happen to be semantically the same, yet syntactically different in source data were collapsed into a single namespace in order to have a canonical name across the datasets. Consequently this keeps the vocabulary slim, and potentially easier for reuse.</p>

                    <p>In the case of country codes, <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes/background_on_iso_3166/iso_3166-2.htm">ISO 3166-2</a> is used as the primary representation for countries. For example, the URI <code><a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CA">http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CA</a></code> identifies the country <em>Canada</em> in the datasets. It contains a <code>skos:exactMatch</code> relation to <code><a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CAN">http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CAN</a></code> and vice-versa.</p>

                    <p>The <em>WDI</em> addresses ~7000 development indicators.</p>

                    <p>The metadata file contains ~86000 triples in which ~8000 are <code>skos:Concept</code>s. Although, the <em>WBPO</em> dataset is a considered to be classifications with ~15000 <code>skos:Concept</code>s, it was kept separately from the metadata file for practical reasons.</p>

                    <p>The 2006 Irish Census dataset was among the first datasets modelled with the Data Cube vocabulary. At the time of the data transformation the specification of the Data Cube vocabulary was still under development and subject to edits. The data model thus co-evolved with the changes made to the vocabulary’s specification.</p>



                    <h4 id="uri-patterns">URI patterns</h4>
                    <p>TODO</p>

                    <h5 id="uri-patterns_world-bank">World Bank</h5>
                    <p>Given the statistical nature of the majority of the World Bank data, URI spaces are created for concepts, properties, observations, and datasets. New URIs for classifications and properties were created because majority of the properties and concepts did not already exist in the wild, and in cases where they did, they did not fully correspond with the World Bank's. For instance, the country codes in the World Bank data are not only composed of concepts of countries, but also other geopolitical areas and income levels. While these concepts are distinguishable from one another given additional patterns in the source data, they still belonged to the same code list. As a widely recommended practice in the Linked Data community, these World Bank resources were interlinked and mapped to external resources.</p>

                    <p>Names in the URIs are kept as close to the names as they occur in the original data as possible in order to minimize misinterpretations and to stay semantically close to the source. Terms are lower-cased, and delimited with the minus-sign for consistent readability and reuse pattern across all of the datasets.</p>

                    <p>Observation URIs in <em>WDI</em> and <em>WBCC</em> datasets follow the same pattern. That is, the dimension values are used as the terms in the URI space and are delimited with a slash. Due to the wide range of observation types in <em>WBF</em> datasets, its URI pattern is simpler in comparison to <em>WDI</em> and <em>WBCC</em>, such that, each observation is instead given a unique numerical row identifier as found in the original data source.</p>

                    <p><em>Slash URIs</em> are used throughout the schema and data resources. The reason for this is to keep the URI patterns consistent and to make sure that all important resources when dereferenced returned information that's particular to the resource. Since the content size of the responses for statistical data may be heavy, the <em>slash URIs</em> approach appeared to be preferable to <em>hash URIs</em>, as the latter would not allow distinct requests in majority of the deployments on the Web. This is of course independent to accessing these resources via SPARQL endpoints.</p>

                    <p>The general URI space consists of:</p>

                    <h4 id="data-conversion_cso-ireland">CSO Ireland</h4>
                    <p>The conversion of 2006 Irish Census data was conducted with a custom Python script based on librdf.[] Due to a relatively small volume of the data the conversion was initially implemented using an in-memory RDF store. Nevertheless, we have discovered it to be insufficient for every but the smallest datasets. Consequently, to cater for the larger datasets, the implementation switched to a file back-end based on <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/products/berkeleydb/overview/index.html">BerkeleyDB</a>.</p>

                    <p>Still, the back-end was not capable of handling the computation of aggregated values using SPARQL queries. To compute aggregates a more performant, standalone triple store would be needed. Ultimately, we have decided to keep the back-end and postpone generation of aggregate values to a later stage when the data would be loaded into a triple store.</p>

                    <p>Another implementation trade-off that we had to make was related to the SPARQL engine in librdf. Due to the engine not being able to execute certain types of SPARQL queries, queries were de-optimized in order for the engine to process them. For example, direct use of URIs in SPARQL graph patterns was not handled properly so that the URIs were matched in the <code>FILTER</code> clause.</p>

                    <p>The most time consuming task of the conversion regarded "reverse engineering" of code lists used in the data. Most code lists were reconstructed manually from the headers and column names in the original data. However, unlike the majority of code lists containing several items, geographical code lists were too large to be processed manually and thus it was necessary to automate their extraction. Geographical code lists, such as the enumeration areas, had to be distilled from the statistical data referring to them. Since the statistical data contained little information about the code lists (e.g., code-name pairs), it was difficult to establish identity in them (e.g., resolve name clashes).</p>

                    <p>The HTML pages are generated and published by the <a href="https://github.com/csarven/linked-data-pages">Linked Data Pages</a> framework, where <a href="http://code.google.com/p/moriarty/">Moriarty</a>, <a href="http://code.google.com/p/paget/">Paget</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/semsol/arc2">ARC2</a> does the heavy lifting for it. Linked Data Pages is used to invoke unique SPARQL queries based on the requested URI. The results are outputted in corresponding HTML templates. Links to alternate RDF formats as well as in JSON are handled by content-negotiation. Given the nature of the invoked SPARQL query, alternate formats may contain additional triples like labels for the vocabulary terms that&#8217;s not in the RDF dumps. This minor difference is mentioned for the users on the site.</p>

XXX: If it makes sense, we might *briefly* talk about applications or "interesting" queries e.g., https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/ccc?key=0AnqqglUUJZt8dF9kdC1OeS10aTg2bWhoME10VmZlZXc


                    <h2 id="application">Application</h2>
                    <p>The application for the the WBLD is viewed in the form of chart visualizations. A custom API is built to pull the necessary data out of the application. The parameters for the API are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>indicator</code>, which accepts a single indicator code (<code>skos:notation</code> of the indicator URI)</li>
                        <li><code>country</code>, which accepts multiple country codes (<code>skos:notation</code> of the country URI)</li>
                        <li><code>year</code>, which accepts a year in YYYY format</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The <code>indicator</code> parameter is a required as one of the dimensions in the observation needs to be known. The other required dimension is either <code>country</code> or <code>year</code>.</p>

                    <p>Two API calls are made due to modular design approach; the first call is made to get the metadata about the indicator, whereas the second call is made to collect either all of the observations for the countries with that indicator, or all of the observations for a given reference period with that indicator. The response data from the API is requested in JSON format in order to pass it on to JavaScript library which handles the visualizations.</p>

                    <h3 id="chart-visualization">Chart visualizations</h3>
                    <p>The <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/view">Tools</a> section on the site uses <a href="https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/">Google Charts Tools</a> to create the visualizations.</p>

                    <h4 id="visualization_world-development-indicators">Visualizing World Development Indicators</h4>
                    <p>Depending on the user selections, and the corresponding API call, two possible charts are generated:</p>

                    <h5 id="visualization_world-development-indicators_motion-chart">Motion chart</h5>
                    <p>It consists of three different views; a bubble chart, bar chart, and line chart. This chart is intended for observation values in countries, over a time period for an indicator. Unique colours are assigned to each country to easily visually separate them from one another. The reference period runs on the x-axis, whereas the measured values run on the y-axis.</p>

                    <h5 id="visualization_world-development-indicators_geo-chart">Geo chart</h5>
                    <p>It consists of a world map view where countries are separated by their official borders. This chart is used to view observation values for a time period for all the countries in the world. The legend consists in the form of a colour spectrum from lowest to highest measured values. The corresponding colours are assigned to each country on the map.</p>
