                    <p>The World Bank Group provides a free and open access to several datasets in their <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog">data catalog</a>. In our use case, we'll take a look at the datasets which compromise the bulk of this available data: <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/world-development-indicators">World Development Indicators</a> (WDI), <a href="https://finances.worldbank.org/">World Bank Finances</a> (WBF), <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/data-catalog/projects-portfolio">World Bank Projects and Operations</a> (WBPO), and <a href="http://data.worldbank.org/developers/climate-data-api">World Bank Climate Change</a> (WBCC). These datasets are available in XML and JSON formats via The World Bank API. Here is a brief summary of the datasets:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><em>World Development Indicators</em> are available as a single data cube where it contains indicators, countries, and time as dimension values, and a measured value.</li>
                        <li><em>World Bank Finances</em> comes in several sub-datasets with different structures i.e., the observations in the datasets contain different dimensions, measures, as well as attributes.</li>
                        <li><em>World Bank Projects and Operations</em> are offered as information on project documents as opposed to statistical observations.</li>
                        <li><em>World Bank Climate Change</em> contains sub-datasets for different historical and future observations. They primarily include data on; reference area, time periods, statistical types (averages and anomalies), measured variables and derived statistics, global circulation models.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The World Bank datasets were collected by making requests to The World Bank API endpoints using the XML output format.

                    <p>The data retrieval process from the World Bank API endpoints is held at irregular periods i.e., several times a month. The retrieval act is partly based on new dataset announcements in World Bank mailing lists. Although the data retrieval and transformation phases are conducted by independent scripts, the commitment to retrieve and store the data is based the readiness of the meaningful and usefulness of the data transformation to an RDF serialization. Hence, Java and Bash scripts are executed manually to retrieve in order to:</p>

                    <h3 id="data-review">Dataset review and decisions</h3>
                    <p>In this section, we cover some of the observed <em>abnormalities</em> in the original datasets, and the decisions which were made in order to later achieve reasonable RDF serializations. The information in this section is meant illustrate the some of the recurring challenges and is not an exhaustive list.</p>

                    <h4 id="data-review_world-bank">World Bank</h4>
                    <p>In order to arrive at a proper and useful Linked Data representation, some of the following problems were solved either with a script or manually updated, and others were brought up to the World Bank team's attention for investigation.</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_missing-units"><em>Missing units</em>: The statistics of the World Development Indicators consists of various indicators in different measurement units. At the time of this writing, these measurements in the source data are only provided as part of the string of the indicator name, as opposed to an explicit XML node [].</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_missing-values"><em>Missing values</em>: Some of the observations in the World Development Indicators dataset do not have measured data. The nodes for the values were given in the API response, however they contained no numerical values []. Hence, in order to keep the RDF-ized version of the dataset lean, these observations were excluded in the data transformation phase.</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_aggregated-data"><em>Aggregated data</em>: While the World Bank API provides endpoints which compiled aggregate data for the <em>WDI</em>, some of these calls were left out in the retrieval process.</p>


                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_most-recent-values"><em>Most recent values</em>: Most recent values were incorrectly introduced to non-date API calls [] in <em>WDI</em>. These observation nodes were excluded in the transformation phase since the data already contained observations with corresponding reference periods.</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_naming-patterns"><em>Naming patterns</em>: Different naming patterns were identified across World Bank datasets. Some of these are as follows:</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_region-names"><em>Region names</em>: Region names as used in <em>WDI</em> and <em>WBF</em> datasets differed [] in a way that although they essentially conveyed the same meaning, labels did not match exactly. In order to have URIs for the region labels in the <em>WBF</em>  observations, and to simplify the linking process, unique region names from the <em>WBF</em>  observations was added to region resources in <em>WDI</em>. During the XSLT process, the alternative labels were matched with the labels in the observations themselves to arrive at their canonical representations.</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_credit-loan"><em>Credit and Loan names</em>: Based on a private discussion with the WFI team, it was determined that the vocabulary terms <em>Credit Status</em> and <em>Loan Status</em>, as well as <em>Credit Number</em> and <em>Loan Number</em> was used interchangeably. Thus, the canonical representation for the Linked Data URI pattern was to use one: <em>Loan Status</em> and <em>Loan Number</em>.</p>

                    <p id="data-review_world-bank_missing-countries"><em>Missing countries</em>: Some country codes were identified in the <em>WDI</em> observations that were not defined in the <em>WDI</em> country code list. These were later added to the original data [] [].</p>

                    <h5 id="vocabularies_world-bank">World Bank</h5>
                    <p>Besides RDF, RDFS, XSD, OWL, the most common vocabularies in these datasets are: <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-data-cube/">RDF Data Cube</a> for modeling statistical observations, <a href="http://purl.org/linked-data/sdmx">SDMX</a> for statistical codes, British reference periods (<a href="http://reference.data.gov.uk/doc/year">Year</a>, <a href="http://reference.data.gov.uk/id/gregorian-interval/">Gregorian Interval</a>), <a href="http://www.w3.org/2004/02/skos/core">SKOS</a>, <a href="http://purl.org/dc/terms/">DC Terms</a>. Where appropriate, properties and classifications were created to represent World Bank Linked Data. The <em><a href="#uri-patterns">URI patterns</a></em> section gives a further break down of this.</p>

                    <p>Properties that happen to be semantically the same, yet syntactically different, in source data was collapsed into a single namespace in order to have a canonical name across the datasets, as well as to minimize the number of vocabulary terms.</p>

                    <p>In the case of country codes, it should be noted that ISO 3166-2 is used as the primary representation for countries. For example, the URI <code><a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CA">http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CA</a></code> identifies the country Canada in the datasets. It contains a <code>skos:exactMatch</code> to <code><a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CAN">http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country/CAN</a></code> and vice-versa with 2 or 3-letter <code>skos:notation</code>s.</p>

New URIs for classifications and properties were created because majority of the properties and concepts did not already exist in the wild, and in cases where they did, they did not fully correspond with the World Bank's. For instance, the country codes in the World Bank data are not only composed of concepts of countries, but also other geopolitical areas and income levels. While these concepts are distinguishable from one another given additional indicators, they still belonged to the same code list. As a widely recommended practice, these World Bank resources were interlinked and mapped to external resources.</p>

                    <p>Names in the URIs are kept as close to the names as they occur in the original data as possible in order to minimize misinterpretations and to stay semantically close to the source. Terms are lower-cased, and delimited with <code>-</code> for consistent readability across all of the datasets.</p>

                    <p>Observation URIs in WDI and WBCC datasets follow the same pattern. That is, the dimension values are used as the terms in the URI space and are delimited with a slash. Due to the wide range of observation types in WBF datasets, its URI pattern is simpler in comparison to WDI and WBCC, such that, each observation is instead given a unique numerical row identifier as found in the original data source.</p>

                    <p><em>Slash URIs</em> are used throughout the schema and data resources. The reason for this is to keep the URI patterns consistent and to make sure that all important resources when dereferenced returned information that's particular to the resource. Since the content size of the responses for statistical data may be heavy, the <em>slash URIs</em> approach appeared to be preferable to <em>hash URIs</em>, as the latter would not allow distinct requests in majority of the deployments on the Web. This is of course independent to accessing these resources via SPARQL endpoints.</p>

                    <p>The general URI space is as follows:</p>

                    <p id="uri-patterns_world-bank_classification"><em>Classifications</em> are composed of code lists for various concepts that are used in the World Bank datasets. The concepts are compiled by using the accompanied meta-data from the World Bank, and are type of a <code>skos:Concept</code>. Each code list is of type <code>skos:CodeList</code> and has a URI pattern of <code>http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/{id}</code>, where id is one of; <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/country"></a>country, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/income-level">income-level</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/indicator">indicator</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/lending-type">lending-type</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/region">region</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/source">source</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/topic">topic</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/project">project</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/currency">currency</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/loan-type">loan-type</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/loan-status">loan-status</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/variable">variable</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/global-circulation-model">global-circulation-model</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/scenario">scenario</a>, <a href="http://worldbank.270a.info/classification/basin">basin</a>.

                    <p>The application for the the WBLD is viewed in the form of chart visualizations. A custom API is built to pull the necessary data out of the application. The parameters for the API are:
                    <ul>
                        <li><code>indicator</code>, which accepts a single indicator code (<code>skos:notation</code> of the indicator URI)</li>
                        <li><code>country</code>, which accepts multiple country codes (<code>skos:notation</code> of the country URI)</li>
                        <li><code>year</code>, which accepts a year in YYYY format</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>The <code>indicator</code> parameter is a required as one of the dimensions in the observation needs to be known. The other required dimension is either <code>country</code> or <code>year</code>.</p>

                    <p>Two API calls are made due to modular design approach; the first call is made to get the metadata about the indicator, whereas the second call is made to collect either all of the observations for the countries with that indicator, or all of the observations for a given reference period with that indicator. The response data from the API is requested in JSON format in order to pass it on to JavaScript library which handles the visualizations.</p>
